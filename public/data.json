      "answer": "Hi Cole, \n\nWe don't have a feature to change the \"from\" email address, all emails are sent from our default address (no-reply@tinselcrm.com). However, you can update the ‚ÄúReply-To‚Äù and \"Display name\" field if you‚Äôd like recipients to respond directly to your email instead and also to update the sender recipient name.\n\nTo do this, go to Settings ‚Üí Email ‚Üí Sending Section.\n\nRegards,\nRalph, Tinsel CRM Support Team",
